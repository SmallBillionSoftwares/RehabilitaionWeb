    <b>RECREATIONAL USE</b><br><br>

<p>Many people who become addicted to recreational drugs, such as speed, cocaine, marijuana, and heroin, start taking drugs on an experimental basis. The majority of individuals who experiment with recreational drugs do so during their teenage years, but it is becoming more common for individuals to start with recreational drugs during adulthood. During the experimental stage, most people do not think that they will become addicted. In fact, in many instances, recreational use does not lead to drug abuse. There are many reasons why people start experimenting with drugs. Many do so because they want to fit in with their peers. Others start using drugs because they want to enhance their energy or improve their athletic performance. It is also common for individuals to use drugs in order to cope with stressful jobs, events, and people. Some individuals start experimenting with drugs in order to deal with intense feelings of anxiety or bouts of depression. While some can experiment once or twice with drugs and decide to never use them again, others seem to become addicted to recreational drugs immediately.
</p>
<p>
 One major reason why people become addicted to recreational drugs is because the majority of them contain addictive substances. It is difficult to determine how much of a particular drug it takes for a person to become addicted because each individual reacts differently to each drug. One person may be able to use a particular drug daily and still remain in control of how much and how often they use the drug. Another person can take the same drug once and develop an intense and continuous craving for it. It is also common for individuals to become addicted to the way a particular drug makes them feel.

<b>PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE</b><br><br>
<p>
Prescription drug abuse is much more common in adults than in teenagers; however, there has been a drastic rise in the number of teens who abuse prescription drugs. Adolescents can gain access to narcotics, barbiturates, amphetamines, and other prescription drugs on the streets, and many of these drugs are being sold by those who have prescriptions for them. Teens can also gain access to these drugs by going through their parent’s medicine cabinets and drawers. It is quite easy for underage kids to gain access to prescription medications because so many adults use them. Painkillers, antidepressants, mood enhancers, sleep aids, and anti-anxiety pills are commonly prescribed to adults by physicians, and these drugs have the ability to ease mental and physical discomfort within minutes.
</p>
<p>
Prescription drug abuse can be just as problematic as recreational drug abuse. Many individuals believe that taking prescription drugs continuously is not as hazardous to a person’s health as taking street drugs, but nothing is further from the truth. Many recreational and prescription drugs are made with the same addictive substances, and a person can overdose on prescription drugs just as easily as they can on recreational drugs. The majority of doctors who prescribe medication to their patients provide strict guidelines on how each patient should use the drug. However, doctors cannot monitor their patient’s activities once they leave the doctor’s office, so they have no control over whether or not patients follow the directions printed on their prescription bottles. Some patients even manipulate doctors into giving them higher doses of a particular drug in order to feed their addiction. In many cases, doctors find out that a patient is addicted to a prescribed drug after the dependency is formed.
